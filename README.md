# Kia ora, I'm Tony 👋

I'm a former architect and burned out product manager, back in the warmth of software engineering. I'm passionate about security, education, and the environment.

More importantly, I'm a dad! Go listen to my kid's [band's music](http://kidsupthetree.band) and [his solo stuff](http://fdasavage.nz).

## 💼 What I Do

I'm a software engineer at @canonical, and do various bits and pieces for [opal3](https://opal3.com), and sometimes find time for some hobby things, if I'm between good books, films, and TV. I love open-source, and am grateful to be able to work on it professionally again, thanks to Canonical!

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools

I've been writing Python since about 2002 and still love it. Mostly backend stuff, but a bit of Django here and there as well. I dabble in other ecosystems and write a bit of Go for work, but keep coming back to Python, and you can see from the repositories below.
