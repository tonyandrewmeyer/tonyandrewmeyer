# Kia ora, I'm Tony 👋

I'm a former architect and burned out product manager, back in the warmth of software engineering. I'm passionate about security, education, and the environment.

More importantly, I'm a dad! Go listen to my kid's [band's music](http://kidsupthetree.band) and [his solo stuff](http://fdasavage.nz).

## 💼 What I Do

I work on various software projects spanning different technologies and domains. My repositories here showcase my work in open source, personal projects, and explorations in software engineering.

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools

I've been writing Python since about 2002 and still love it. Mostly backend stuff, but a bit of Django here and there as well. I dabble in other ecosystems and write a bit of Go for work, but keep coming back to Python, and you can see from the repositories below.
