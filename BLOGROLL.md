# Blogroll

[Blogrolls and reblogs](https://sethmlarson.dev/reblog-tweet-toot-skoot-skeet) are what we had before retweets and boosts. This is a list of links to stuff on the internet that I enjoyed and want to share with others.

Additionally, I share all the [RSS feeds](feeds.opml) I follow and [article URLs](articles.opml) using [OPML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML), an open standard for sharing groups of links with text and other metadata. You can import the feeds directly into your reader app of choice.
