    Staff engineers often take on ambiguous, messy, difficult problems and do just enough work on them to make them manageable by someone else. Once the problem is tractable, it becomes a growth opportunity for less experienced engineers (sometimes with support from the staff engineer).

    I asked on Rands Leadership Slack about how everyone approaches knowing things, and a common thread was paying attention to information that isn’t secret exactly, but isn’t necessarily for you. This included reading senior people’s calendars, skimming agendas or notes for meetings you’re not in, and—something that had never occurred to me—looking at the full list of Slack channels sorted by most recently created so you can see what new projects are happening.

    When I spoke with Zach Millman, pillar tech lead at Asana, about creating a strategy there, he told me that he used the process of nemawashi, one of the pillars of the Toyota Production System. It means sharing information and laying the foundations so that by the time a decision is made, there’s already a consensus of opinion. 11 If there’s someone who’ll need to give a thumbs-up to your plan, you’ll want those people to show up to any decision-making meeting already convinced that the change is the right thing to do. I’ve always framed this as “Don’t call for a vote until you know you have the votes,” but I was delighted to learn that there’s a word for it.

If you’re wrong, people will tell you and you’ll learn something, and you can change direction if you need to.

Having disagreements about your design doesn’t mean that you need to change course, but it gives you information you wouldn’t have had otherwise.

    If someone goes out of their way to help you, say thank you. In companies that have peer bonuses or spot bonuses, there’s already a structure for saying thank you: use it. If the team is located together, can you send them a thank-you gift, like fancy tea or chocolate? At least include them in the list of people you thank in the launch email.

</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Competence is built on knowledge and experience, but you also need to be able to apply those abilities. That starts with having the self-awareness to know what you can do, how long it will take, and what you don’t know. It means being able to say “I’ve got this” and knowing that you do, in fact, have this. Competence means having well-founded confidence that you’ll be able to solve the problem. You don’t need to be arrogant, speak in incomprehensible jargon, or show off. True confidence comes from having done the work for long enough that you’ve learned to trust yourself.

<div class="noteText">
    Being competent doesn’t mean you need to be the best. I’ve sometimes seen tech people be shy about claiming to be an expert, because they can always think of someone in the industry who is better than they are. Don’t set your bar at “best in the industry.”

</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Your standards will serve as a model for how other people work. Know what high-quality work looks like and aim for that standard in everything you do, not just the parts you enjoy most. Write the clearest documentation you can. Be the first person to know if your software breaks. There are always trade-offs, of course: sometimes the right move is to slap a solution together with duct tape as quickly as possible. But make that determination based on the problem you’re trying to solve, not how interesting the work is to you.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_aqua">aqua</span>) - Have High Standards > Page 365 · Location 5832
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Having high standards means making your work as good as it can be. Look for opportunities to put aside your ego and ask someone else to help make your work better. Ask for code review, design review, and peer evaluations. When you’ve got an idea you love, invite your colleagues to poke holes in it. When you “request comments,” don’t secretly resent them; each one is an opportunity to make your solution better, so take them seriously even if you don’t use them all. Your solutions are not you and they don’t define you. Criticism of your work isn’t criticism of you.

My coworker Tim cleaned up my mess and I’ll never forget his reaction: “It’s always interesting to see how new people handle their first screw-up. We’ve all been there.” It was such a relief!

    While you may be the best coder on the team, the most experienced engineer, or the fastest problem solver, that doesn’t mean you should jump on all of the problems. You’re working as part of a team, not a collection of competing individuals. Don’t become a single point of failure where the team can’t get anything done when you’re not available.

    So take the time to leave your production environment, codebase, or documentation so that it just works for whoever comes along next. Write tests that will let you refactor your code without breaking things. Follow your style guide so that the people who copy your approach will also be following your style guide. Leave no traps, like dangerous scripts that everyone needs to remember not to run or configurations that are changed locally but not updated in source control. Make it safe to move around.

    Look for optimizations that will let you build, deploy, and release more quickly: smaller builds, intuitive tooling, fixing or deleting flaky tests, repeatable processes, automation everywhere. Be judicious about where you invest: building tooling, platforms, or processes takes time, so choose the optimizations that will genuinely make a difference.

    Before you offer your thoughts, think about whether the other person is asking for them. Think too about whether you even have enough context to tell them something that’s both helpful and nonobvious. If you’re not sure whether your advice will be welcome, ask them.

    What’s the difference between telling people things and teaching them things? Understanding. When you’re giving advice, you’re explaining how you relate to the topic, and the receiver can take your advice or leave it. When you’re teaching, you’re trying to have the other person not just receive the information but internalize it for themselves.

    Successful teaching includes hands-on learning and activating knowledge: the student should be doing as well as listening. Find opportunities to let them lead, whether that means using the tool themselves, typing commands, or opening tabs on their laptop instead of yours. It’s even better if they end up with an “artifact” to refer back to, like a diagram or code snippet.

    your colleagues won’t learn as much if you only delegate the work after you’ve turned it into “beautifully packaged, cleanly wrapped gifts.” If you instead give them “a messy, unscoped project with a bit of a safety net,” they’ll get a chance to hone their problem-solving abilities, build their own support system, and stretch their skill set. A messy project is a learning opportunity that’s hard to get otherwise.

    In fact, it’s easy to gain a specialty accidentally just because it’s what you’re doing at work: one experience leads to another, and next thing you know you have a specialization. Spend five years writing storage systems, for example, and you’re going to get good at writing storage systems: you’ll have relevant skills, you’ll work with other storage experts, and you’ll have storage-related lines on your résumé. When an ex-colleague is hiring a storage expert, they’ll think of you.

    If your job is giving you what you need, there’s no need to change anything. I want to emphasize that because our industry puts a lot of focus on changing jobs frequently, and the regular “new job” announcements can make you feel like you should be moving too. If you’re in a growing niche, you might be able to stay in the same team and still have plenty of room to learn and grow for decades. Or you might not be looking for further growth at all: you may just want to use your current skills and keep doing much the same job until you retire.

    Success can mean working less in your current role. One engineer I spoke with, Jens Rantil, swapped a staff engineering role for 80% time and a 20% pay cut at a much smaller company. As he said, “Every Thursday is a Friday! It’s amazing!”
